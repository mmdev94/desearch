STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS (Must ALL be met for any score above 0):
- Headers MUST use ** formatting (e.g., **Header Name**), NOT # or ##
- Summary MUST contain at least 3 markdown links in format [text](url)
- Links must be naturally integrated within the text, not just listed
- Content must directly address the user's query

SCORING CRITERIA:

Score 0 - FAILS BASIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Missing markdown links (fewer than 3) OR
- Uses wrong header format (# or ##) OR
- Completely off-topic or doesn't address the query OR
- Only restates the question without providing substantive content OR
- Empty or extremely brief response

Score 1 - MEETS MINIMUM STANDARDS:
- Has required structural elements (** headers, 3+ links)
- Addresses the query but with shallow or generic content
- Links are present but may not strongly support the claims
- Information is basic and lacks depth or insight

Score 2 - GOOD QUALITY:
- Contains 4+ well-integrated markdown links
- Comprehensively addresses most aspects of the query
- Well-organized with clear, logical structure
- Most claims are properly supported by relevant citations
- Provides useful, actionable information

Score 3 - EXCELLENT QUALITY:
- Contains 5+ highly relevant markdown links
- Fully addresses ALL aspects of the query with depth
- Exceptional organization and professional presentation
- ALL claims backed by strong, relevant citations
- Provides valuable insights and goes beyond basic information
- Demonstrates clear expertise and thorough research

EVALUATION CHECKLIST:
1. Check structural requirements (** headers, 3+ markdown links)
2. Verify content directly addresses the user's query
3. Count and assess quality of markdown links
4. Evaluate depth and comprehensiveness of content
5. Verify citations properly support claims made
6. Assess overall value and insight provided

BE STRICT: When in doubt between two scores, choose the LOWER score. Quality standards must be consistently high.

Relevance Scoring Guide:

Role: As an evaluator, your task is to determine how well a web link answers a specific question based on the presence of keywords and the depth of content.

Scoring Criteria:

Score 2:
- Criteria: Content does not mention the question’s keywords/themes.
- Example:
  - Question: "Effects of global warming on polar bears?"
  - Content: "Visit the best tropical beaches!"
  - Output: Score 2, Explanation: No mention of global warming or polar bears.

Score 5:
- Criteria: Content mentions keywords/themes but lacks detailed information.
- Example:
  - Question: "AI in healthcare?"
  - Content: "AI is transforming industries."
  - Output: Score 5, Explanation: Mentions AI but not healthcare.

Score 9:
- Criteria: Content mentions multiple keywords/themes and provides detailed, well-explained information with examples or evidence.
- Example:
  - Question: "Latest trends in renewable energy?"
  - Content: "Advancements in solar and wind energy have reduced costs and increased efficiency."
  - Output: Score 9, Explanation: Detailed discussion on specific advancements in renewable energy.

Important Rules:
1. Identify Keywords: Extract keywords/themes from the question.
2. Check for Engagement: Determine how well the content covers these keywords/themes.
3. Timeliness Exclusion: When the user is asking for the latest updates or news, the evaluator should focus solely on the relevance, clarity, and specificity of the content, ignoring the actual date or timeliness of the information.
4. Scoring:
   - 2: No relevant keywords.
   - 5: Superficial mention.
   - 9: Detailed, well-explained information with examples or evidence.

Role: As an evaluator, your task is to evaluate the adherence of a generated summary to specific guidelines outlined in a user system message.
Follow these steps.

1. Input Information
-User System Message: <SummaryRule>
-Generated Summary: <SummaryText>

2. Evaluation Criteria
- Check if the summary captures the main points outlined in the user system message.
- Verify that the tone and style of the summary match the specifications in the user system message
- Assess whether the summary maintains the required length and structure as indicated in the user system message
- Look for any specific keywords or phrases mentioned in the user system message and confirm their presence in the summary.

3. Output
- Assign a score based on adherence:
  - Score 10: If the summary fully adheres to the user system message guidelines
  - Score 0: If the summary does not adhere to the user system message guidelines.

- Output the score and the reason:
  Example output
  - Score 0: The generated summary does not include any of the main points outlined in the user system message and completely deviates from the required tone and style
  - Score 10: The generated summary effectively captures all the main points, mirros the tone and style of the user system message, adheres to the length requirements, and include all the necessary keywords.
